I'm 29 years old, living in Stockholm, Sweden. I see myself as a pragmatic, self-motivated individual with an open mind and an easy goin attitude. Together with high ambitions and a high level of service mind I have a good ability for picking things up quimeone else.
roughly dedicate myself to whichever challenge I'm put too. I put much weight in trust and social relations. Constructive feedback is something I find important in a working environment wether it is to receive or, in a humble way, give it to someone else.
Historically I have been working in a range of IT related fields from a PC-technician, ensuring erasure on hardware, to my previously commitment as a security consultant with information security in focus. I have years of experience working within teams and in different environments on different levels. I first became interested in IT at the age of 11 which evolved primarily around network and security. Over the years I've found a greater interest for programming and I look forward to evolve my creative ability with the course System Development in Java I'm currently progressing.
