			<header>About me</header>
			<p>
				I see myself as a pragmatic, self-motivated individual with an open mind and an easy goin attitude. With high ambitions and a high level of service mind I have a good ability for picking things up quickly and thoroughly dedicate myself to whichever challenge I'm put too. I put much weight in trust and social relations. Constructive feedback is something I find important in a working environment wether it is to receive or give it to someone else in a proper manner.<br/>
				Historically I have been working in a range of IT related fields from a PC-technician, ensuring erasure on hardware, to my previously commitment as a security consultant with information security in focus. I have years of experience working within teams in different environments on different levels. I first became interested in IT at the age of 11 which evolved primarily around network and security.<br/>
				Over the years I've found a greater interest for programming and I look forward to evolve my creative ability with the course "<strong>System Development in Java</strong>" I'm currently progressing.

			<h2>Where do you see yourselves in 2 years?</h2>
			<h4> Professionally:</h4>
			<p>
				I picture myself, as a full-time developer, in a flexible working environment being a member of a productive developer-team with enough room to grow in. Having the possibilities of doing both back-end infrastructure and front-end applications perhaps with specialization on mobile platforms. I also wish that I have the opportunity to explore my creativeness within different areas of development assignments to find the right area for me.<br/>
				I hope that my passion of developing will take me down the road to private, smaller projects with various challenges in different areas.
