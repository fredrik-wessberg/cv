				<p><br/>
					I'm 29 years old, living in Stockholm, Sweden. I see myself as a pragmatic, self-motivated individual with an open mind and an easy goin attitude. Together with high ambitions and a high level of service mind I have a good ability for picking things up quickly and thoroughly dedicate myself to whichever challenge I'm put too wiith the right support. I put much weight in trust and social relations. Constructive feedback is something I find important in a working environment wether it is to receive or, in a humble way, give it to someone else.<br/>
					Historically I have been working in a range of IT related fields from a PC-technician, ensuring erasure on hardware, to my previously commitment as a security consultant with information security in focus. I have years of experience working within teams in different environments on different levels. I first became interested in IT at the age of 11 which evolved primarily around network and security. Over the years I've found a greater interest for programming and I look forward to evolve my creative ability with the course "<strong>System Development in Java</strong>" I'm currently progressing.

				<h3>Where do you see yourselves proffesionally in 2 years?</h3>
				<p>
					I hope to see, as a full-time developer, in an open working environment being a member of a developer-team doing back-end infrastructure applications with specialization on mobile platforms. At the same time I put much weight in having the the oppurtunity to explore my creativeness within different areas of development assignments.
